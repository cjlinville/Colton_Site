## Hi, I‚Äôm Colton

I‚Äôm passionate about all things geospatial and the transformative impact it can have on our world.

## About Me

I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah working as the GIS Dept. Manager for Aero-Graphics Inc.
How did I get here?
I spent the most formative years of my life going on adventures up and down the Appalachian mountains. My Dad taught me how to fish, ride a bike, hunt, hike, and how to be outside. 
One summer I broke my leg (long story), and decided to try my hand at rock climbing. How thankful I am for that broken tibia, because the world of climbing changed my life. 

My appreciation for the natural world grew as I experienced the most sacred crags in the Eastern US. I realized that places some may dismiss are temples to others. A wild stream might be the most beautiful place in the world to a fisherman. One trail can change a mountainbikers life. TO BE CONTINUED....

## How I like to work

- **Python-first:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely/pyproj, PDAL where it helps.
- **Simple deploys:** static frontends on Pages/Netlify + small APIs when necessary.
- **Portable data:** prefer open formats; pre-tile big datasets for performance.
- **Reproducible:** scripts + docs so someone (including future me) can rerun it.

## Tools I reach for

- **Python:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, NumPy, Shapely, Fiona.
- **DB/Server:** PostGIS, ogr2ogr/GDAL, FastAPI, Docker (when needed).
- **Maps:** MapLibre GL JS, PMTiles, Tippecanoe.
- **Build/hosting:** GitHub Pages + Actions, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages.

## Currently

- Prototyping an **all-activities** personal heatmap (vector tiles + MapLibre).
- Automating a **LiDAR ‚Üí DSM/contours** flow with basic QA gates.
- Writing short notes and keeping examples tidy for reuse.

## Outside of work

I like long rides, tinkering with map styles, and exploring new terrain visualizations.  
Occasionally I‚Äôll write up what worked (or didn‚Äôt) on the blog.
