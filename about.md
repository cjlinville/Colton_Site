## About Me

I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah working as the GIS Dept. Manager for Aero-Graphics Inc.
{:.lead}
How did I get here?
{:.lead}
I spent the most formative years of my life on adventures in and around the Appalachian mountains. My Dad taught me how to fish, hike, ride a bike, and how to be outside. Eventually I fell headfirst into the world of rock climbing. This was my gateway drug to mountain biking, trail running, ski touring, mountaineering, and everything in between.
{:.lead}
My appreciation for the natural world grew as I experienced what the Eastern US had to offer. I began to undestand that places unremarkable to some, are temples to others. A wild stream might be sacred to a fisherman. A single trail can mean so much the right person. Even a railroad cut can bring a climbing community together.
{:.lead}
My passions brought me to Boone, North Carolina, where I graduated from Appalachian State University with a B.S. in Geology, and a certificate in GIS.
Geology was the perfect spatial adjacent warmup to what I quickly understood to be my calling in life. I was enamoured with GIS, remote sensing, and environmental science. The multidisciplinary nature of these fields give way to endless possibilities that drive real world impacts. Nothing was more obvious to me than using these principles to ensure the conservation and protection of our cultural, recreational, and natural resources.
{:.lead}
Shortly after graduating, and being propelled by adventure, I moved to Salt Lake City. Here, I spent countless hours learning, researching, and throwing myself into personal projects. A lot is possible with a can-do attitude and a thirst for learning.
I found myself bouncing between a few jobs until settling at Aero-Graphics.

## How I like to work

- **Python-first:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely/pyproj, PDAL where it helps.
- **Simple deploys:** static frontends on Pages/Netlify + small APIs when necessary.
- **Portable data:** prefer open formats; pre-tile big datasets for performance.
- **Reproducible:** scripts + docs so someone (including future me) can rerun it.

## Tools I reach for

- **Python:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, NumPy, Shapely, Fiona.
- **DB/Server:** PostGIS, ogr2ogr/GDAL, FastAPI, Docker (when needed).
- **Maps:** MapLibre GL JS, PMTiles, Tippecanoe.
- **Build/hosting:** GitHub Pages + Actions, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages.

## Currently

- Prototyping an **all-activities** personal heatmap (vector tiles + MapLibre).
- Automating a **LiDAR ‚Üí DSM/contours** flow with basic QA gates.
- Writing short notes and keeping examples tidy for reuse.

## Outside of work

I like long rides, tinkering with map styles, and exploring new terrain visualizations.  
Occasionally I‚Äôll write up what worked (or didn‚Äôt) on the blog.
