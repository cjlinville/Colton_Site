## About Me

I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah working as the GIS Dept. Manager for Aero-Graphics Inc.
{:.lead}
How did I get here?
{:.lead}
I spent the most formative years of my life on adventures in and around the Appalachian mountains. My Dad taught me how to fish, hike, ride a bike, and how to be outside. Eventually I fell headfirst into the world of rock climbing. This was my gateway drug to mountain biking, trail running, ski touring, mountaineering, and everything in between.
{:.lead}
My appreciation for the natural world grew as I experienced what the Eastern US had to offer. I began to undestand that places unremarkable to some, are temples to others. A wild stream might be sacred to a fisherman. A single trail can mean so much the right person. Even a railroad cut can bring a climbing community together.
{:.lead}
My passions brought me to Boone, North Carolina, where I graduated from Appalachian State University with a B.S. in Geology, and a certificate in GIS.
Months spent field mapping...geology...real passion in GIS...multidisciplinary...real impact



## How I like to work

- **Python-first:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely/pyproj, PDAL where it helps.
- **Simple deploys:** static frontends on Pages/Netlify + small APIs when necessary.
- **Portable data:** prefer open formats; pre-tile big datasets for performance.
- **Reproducible:** scripts + docs so someone (including future me) can rerun it.

## Tools I reach for

- **Python:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, NumPy, Shapely, Fiona.
- **DB/Server:** PostGIS, ogr2ogr/GDAL, FastAPI, Docker (when needed).
- **Maps:** MapLibre GL JS, PMTiles, Tippecanoe.
- **Build/hosting:** GitHub Pages + Actions, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages.

## Currently

- Prototyping an **all-activities** personal heatmap (vector tiles + MapLibre).
- Automating a **LiDAR ‚Üí DSM/contours** flow with basic QA gates.
- Writing short notes and keeping examples tidy for reuse.

## Outside of work

I like long rides, tinkering with map styles, and exploring new terrain visualizations.  
Occasionally I‚Äôll write up what worked (or didn‚Äôt) on the blog.
